# 🚗 RoadScout V0.01

RoadScout is a vehicle tracking and analytics system designed to process live camera feeds to detect and count vehicles in real time. It utilizes cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision technologies to provide insights into road utilization, parking lot usage, and vehicle activity trends.

# ✨ Features

📹 Real-Time Vehicle Detection: Processes video streams to detect vehicles using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model

📊 Analytics:
        Tracks total vehicle counts and unique vehicles based on their appearances.
        Records timestamped data for detailed analysis.
        
🌐 Client-Server Architecture:
        Client: Captures video using a USB camera connected to a Raspberry Pi and streams it to the server.
        Server: Processes the stream using YOLOv8, tracks analytics, and displays both live statistics and bounding-boxed visuals.

🖥️ Terminal-Based UI:
        Displays dynamic stats in a clean and interactive terminal interface using rich.
        
🪟 Pop-Out Camera View:
        Displays bounding boxes on detected vehicles in a separate window.
# 🔮 Future Improvements:

📹 Multi-Camera Support:
    Handle multiple camera streams for larger-scale monitoring.

📊 Expanded Analytics:
    Provide detailed breakdowns of vehicle counts by time intervals or zones.

🌐 Dashboard Integration:
    Develop a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and reporting.

🚛 Vehicle Type Classification:
    Extend detection to classify vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks, buses).
    

# 🎯 Intended Use Cases
🚦 Tracking Parking Lot Analytics:
        Analyze parking lot usage by monitoring the number of cars entering and leaving.
        Understand peak usage times and average duration of stay.

🛣️ Tracking Road Utilization:
        Monitor vehicle flow on roads to identify bottlenecks or underutilized areas.
        Use data to inform urban planning or road network improvements.

🎟️ Event Planning and Logistics:
            Measure traffic near event venues to optimize parking and road access.

🏬 Retail and Commercial Analytics:
            Monitor traffic near retail outlets to assess potential customer reach.

🌍 Environmental Impact Studies:
            Use vehicle count data to estimate traffic-related emissions.

⚠️ Accident Prevention and Safety Improvements:
            Identify high-traffic zones and implement measures to reduce congestion-related risks.




# 🚀 How It Works

Client:
    Captures video using a USB camera.
    Streams the video to the server via a TCP connection.

Server:
    Processes incoming video streams using YOLOv8 for vehicle detection.
    Tracks the number of cars and unique vehicles over time.
    Updates a terminal-based UI with real-time stats and shows a pop-out window with the live video feed and bounding boxes.

Output:
    Provides analytics on the number of vehicles detected and unique vehicles identified.
    Enables live visualization of camera data.
