# RoadScout

RoadScout is a machine vision project designed to track vehicles in real-time using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking). It records vehicle data and exports it to a spreadsheet for analysis. This tool is ideal for traffic monitoring, vehicle counting, and data-driven insights.

## Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Detects vehicles (cars and trucks) from a live camera feed.
- **Object Tracking**: Assigns unique IDs to vehicles using the SORT algorithm.
- **Data Logging**: Outputs vehicle counts, timestamps, and unique vehicle IDs to an Excel file.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust detection confidence, tracking parameters, and update intervals using a configuration file.
